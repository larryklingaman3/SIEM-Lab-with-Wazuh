# SIEM Lab with Wazuh

## Project Overview
This lab provided hands-on experience with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using Wazuh. I installed and configured the Wazuh manager and deployed both Windows and Linux agents to centralize log collection, monitor security events, and generate alerts for potential incidents. The environment was configured to improve overall security posture through proactive monitoring and policy enforcement.

## Key Achievements
- Installed and configured Wazuh SIEM.  
- Deployed and configured Windows and Linux agents for log collection.  
- Centralized monitoring of system events and security alerts.  
- Implemented security rules and policies to enhance protection.  
- Analyzed events and responded to simulated security incidents.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM deployment and management with Wazuh.  
- Log collection and analysis across heterogeneous systems.  
- Security monitoring, alerting, and incident response.  
- Policy creation and enforcement for proactive defense.  
- Virtual machine management using VMware.

## Process Summary
1. Installed and configured the Wazuh manager.  
2. Deployed Windows and Linux agents to target systems.  
3. Centralized log collection from all agents.  
4. Configured monitoring rules and alerting policies.  
5. Implemented security policies and best practices.  
6. Analyzed logs and responded to simulated incidents.

## Outcome
This project strengthened my ability to deploy and manage a SIEM solution, collect and analyze logs from multiple OS platforms, and implement proactive monitoring to improve security visibility and response.
